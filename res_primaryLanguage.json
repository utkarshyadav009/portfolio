        "description": "The project implements Phase-Functioned Neural Network (PFNN) by Daniel Holden (2017) within Unreal Engine to manage complex character animations. The project creates a custom plugin to access third party libraries used in the orignal paper and to stream line the process of recreating the paper in Unreal Engine. Despite advancements in loading network weights asynchronously and calculating trajectories, two primary challenges persist. First, character mesh often undergoes deformation, significantly impacting the visual quality of animations. Second, trajectory calculation inaccuracies lead to inconsistencies in movement predictions. These core issues currently compromise the efficacy of the system, and addressing them forms the crux of ongoing and future development efforts.",

The control rig was created with bone controllers for manipulating the gecko's feet based on external data. Feet position was calculated using line traces, allowing the gecko to step in an arc onto new positions. The Full Body IK node calculated bone positions using inverse kinematics algorithms, resulting in realistic character animations. A post-process animation blueprint enhanced believability by layering multiple animations, incorporating physical simulations, and adjusting body parts. This blueprint seamlessly blended animations to create lifelike gecko behavior. The project leverages Unreal Engine's powerful animation tools to achieve dynamic and immersive character movements",
